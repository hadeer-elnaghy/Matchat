A system for booking playgrounds includes an admin panel for managing playgrounds and booking schedules, a website for users to reserve time slots, and a feature for users to invite friends to play matches together. Here's a breakdown:

## Admin Panel:
• The admin panel serves as the backend interface for playground administrators to manage playground listings, available time slots, and reservation settings.
• Administrators can add, edit, and remove playgrounds, set availability for booking, and oversee the booking schedule to avoid conflicts.
• They can also manage user accounts, view booking analytics, and send notifications to users regarding availability and updates.

## Website for Users:
• The website provides users with a platform to browse available playgrounds, view schedules, and book time slots for playing.
• Users can create accounts, search for playgrounds based on location or amenities, select preferred time slots, and make reservations online.
• Additionally, users can invite friends to join them for matches, create teams, and coordinate game schedules through the platform.
• Users have the option to invite friends to join them for matches or games at the booked playgrounds.
• They can add friends to their group, send invitations, and manage team rosters for friendly matches or competitive games.
• The system facilitates communication between users and their friends, making it easy to organize matches and enjoy playing sports together.
